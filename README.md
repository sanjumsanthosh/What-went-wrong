## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm/yarn/pnpm
- A Groq API key or Azure OpenAI key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/what-went-wrong.git
cd what-went-wrong
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
# Or for Azure:
AZURE_AI_KEY=your_azure_key
AZURE_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
AZURE_MODEL_NAME=your_model_name
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Usage

1. **Model Selection**: Choose between Groq or Azure/GitHub models and enter your API token
2. **Initial Questions**: Answer the first 6 pre-defined questions about your habit
3. **AI Questions**: The system generates follow-up questions based on your responses
4. **Analysis**: After 8 questions, receive a detailed analysis of:
   - What went wrong (patterns, obstacles, environment factors)
   - What to do next (actionable steps, suggestions, improvements)
